      <li>Elegant/fast way to upload data</li>

      <li>Make it snappy</li>
      <li>Fulfill the exercise expectations</li>
      <li>Write clear and well-structured code. You wonâ€™t work alone. It should be easy to understand and modify your code.</li>
      <li>Send working instructions. Do you imagine you buy a product that you need to install by yourself and when you follow the instructions provided, it does not work? It would be frustrating.</li>
      <li>Write clear and well-structured code. You wonâ€™t work alone. It should be easy to understand and modify your code.</li>
      <li><strong>We expect a README file in the repository.</strong> This README must explain very clearly the instructions for us to start the application without any type of debugging or complication. The instructions must work out of the box. <strong>This is one of the most important part of the problem.</strong> You need to think always about who is going to use it and try to reduce frustration.</li>
